This code package may be found online at <a href="http://code.sgurbani.com/cis/source/pa1-2/">http://code.sgurbani.com/cis/source/pa1-2/</a>
no earlier than the submission date for PA2 (on or after November 4, 2010).


--OVERVIEW--

The purpose of this assignment was to develop a code package to calculate a 3D Point Cloud to Point Cloud Registration. 
The full details of the assignment can be found in the following PDF: <a href="ProgrammingAssignments1and2.pdf">ProgrammingAssignments1and2</a>.

Our paper, explaining our work on this assignment, can be found in the following PDF: <a href="report/PA1.pdf">PA1.pdf</a>.

--PROGRAM STRUCTURE--

Uses the following 14 files located in the /source/ directory.

-point3D.m 			- struct defining a 3-dim point
-rotate3D.m 			- applies a frame rotation to a point in space
-frame3D.m 			- defines a frame transformation (rotate + translate)
-inverseFrame3D.m 		- calculates the inverse transformation of a given one
-transform3D.m 			- performs a frame transformation between 2 points
-register3D.m 			- performs a series of frame transformations
-getTransformation.m 		- calculates the transformation between 2 point clouds
-EMCalibration.m 		- determine the position of dimple relative to EM tracker
-OptCalibration.m 		- determine the position of dimple rel. to Opt tracker
-readCalBody.m 			- reads in the CalBody.txt files
-readCalReadings.m 		- reads in the CalReadings.txt files
-readEMpivot.m 			- read in the empivot.txt files
-readOptPivot.m 		- read in the optpivot.txt files
-p1Driver.m 			- A MATLAB script file to run the program


--INPUT / OUTPUT--

Input files are located in the /input/ directory.

Input files should be of the form "pa1-debug-X-TYPE.txt" or "pa1-unknown-X-TYPE.txt", where X is the letter of the 
data set and TYPE is the type of input data (calreadings, calbody, etc). The form "pa1-debug-" will be used if a corresponding "pa1-debug-X-output1.txt"
is found, otherwise the "pa1-unknown-" form will be used.

Output: creates one file named "pa1-X-output1.txt" in the /output/ directory for every input data set, where X is the letter of the data set.


--EXECUTING PROGRAM--

The script file p1Driver.m located in /source/pa1-2/ is to be run from the MATLAB command window.


--REPORT--

The <a href="report">report/</a> directory contains our programming journal and reports.
The <a href="report/related_papers">report/related_papers/</a> directory contains PDFs of journal articles we cite and use for our program.
