This code package may be found online at <a href="http://code.sgurbani.com/cis/source/pa1-2/">http://code.sgurbani.com/cis/source/pa1-2/</a>
no earlier than the submission date for PA2 (on or after November 4, 2010).


--OVERVIEW--

The purpose of this assignment was to update the code package to calculate a distortion function for the EM tracker space.
Then, we use the undistorted space to register CT images w.r.t. real world using fiducials. 
The full details of the assignment can be found in the following PDF: <a href="ProgrammingAssignments1and2.pdf">ProgrammingAssignments1and2</a>.

Our paper, explaining our work on this assignment, can be found in the following PDF: <a href="report/PA2.pdf">PA2.pdf</a>.


--PROGRAM STRUCTURE--

Uses the following 17 files located in the /source/ directory.

-point3D.m 			- struct defining a 3-dim point
-rotate3D.m 			- applies a frame rotation to a point in space
-frame3D.m 			- defines a frame transformation (rotate + translate)
-inverseFrame3D.m 		- calculates the inverse transformation of a given one
-transform3D.m 			- performs a frame transformation between 2 points
-register3D.m 			- performs a series of frame transformations
-getTransformation.m 		- calculates the transformation between 2 point clouds
-EMCalibration.m 		- determine the position of dimple relative to EM tracker
-OptCalibration.m 		- determine the position of dimple rel. to Opt tracker
-readCalBody.m 			- reads in the CalBody.txt files
-readCalReadings.m 		- reads in the CalReadings.txt files
-readEMpivot.m 			- read in the empivot.txt files
-readOptPivot.m 		- read in the optpivot.txt files
-readCTFiducials.m		- read in the -ct-fiducials.txt files
-getCorrection.m		- calculates the distortion function between a distorted and expected data set
-applyCorrection.m		- applies a distortion function to a distorted data set
-p2Driver.m 			- A MATLAB script file to run the program


--INPUT / OUTPUT--

Input files are located in the /input/ directory.

Input files should be of the form "pa1-debug-X-TYPE.txt" or "pa1-unknown-X-TYPE.txt", where X is the letter of the 
data set and TYPE is the type of input data (calreadings, calbody, etc). The form "pa1-debug-" will be used if a corresponding "pa1-debug-X-output1.txt"
is found, otherwise the "pa1-unknown-" form will be used.

Output: creates two files named "pa1-X-output1.txt" and "pa1-X-output2.txt" in the /output/ directory for every input data set, 
where X is the letter of the data set.


--EXECUTING PROGRAM--

The script file p2Driver.m located in /source/pa1-2/ is to be run from the MATLAB command window.


--REPORT--

The <a href="report">report/</a> directory contains our programming journal and reports.
The <a href="report/related_papers">report/related_papers/</a> directory contains PDFs of journal articles we cite and use for our program.
